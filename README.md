# AugustMiniHack
The repo for the August 1st Mini Hack. A web based 3D music visualization.

The music for the visualization works by creating a folder called "music" in the root folder and adding an MP3 called "test". 

This was put together in roughly 2 hours and though the code isn't beautful what it creates is :)
